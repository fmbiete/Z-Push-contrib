Installing Z-Push
======================

Requirements
------------

Z-Push 2 runs only on PHP 5.1 or later
A PEAR dependency as in previous versions does not exist in Z-Push 2.

The PHP version requirement is met in these distributions and versions (or later).

Debian      4.0 (etch)
Ubuntu      8.04 (hardy heron)
RHEL/CentOS 5.5
Fedora      5 (bordeaux)
OpenSuse    10.1
Slackware   12.0
Gentoo      2006.1
FreeBSD     6.1
OpenBSD     4.0
Mandriva    2007

If your distribution is not listed here, you can check which PHP version
is default for it at http://distrowatch.com/.

Additional php packages
----------------------
To use the full featureset of Z-Push 2 and the z-push-top command line utility, 
additional php packages are required. These provide SOAP support, access to 
process control and shared memory. 

These packages vary in names between the distributions.
- Generally install the packages:                   php-cli php-soap 
- On Suse (SLES & OpenSuse) install the packages:   php53 php53-soap php53-pcntl php53-sysvshm php53-sysvsem php53-posix
- On RHEL based systems install the package:        php-cli php-soap php-process
  To install this package you need to add an extra channel subscription from the 
  RHEL Server Optional channel.


How to install
--------------

To install Z-Push, simply untar the z-push archive, e.g. with:
   tar -xzvf z-push-[version]-{buildnr}.tar.gz
   
The tar contains a folder which has the following structure:
    z-push-[version]-{buildnr}
    
The contents of this folder should be copied to /usr/share/z-push.
In a case that /usr/share/z-push does not exist yet, create it with:
    mkdir -p /usr/share/z-push

    cp -R z-push-[version]-{buildnr}/* /usr/share/z-push/

Edit the config.php file in the Z-Push directory to fit your needs.
If you intend to use Z-Push with Zarafa backend and Zarafa is installed
on the same server, it should work out of the box without changing anything.
Please also set your timezone in the config.php file.

The parameters and their roles are also explained in the config.php file.

By default the state directory is /var/lib/z-push, the log directory /var/log/z-push.
Make sure that these directories exist and are writeable for your webserver
process, so either change the owner of these directories to the UID of
your apache process or make the directories world writeable:

    chmod 755 /var/lib/z-push /var/log/z-push
    chown apache:apache /var/lib/z-push /var/log/z-push
    
For the default webserver user please refer to your distribution's manual.

Now, you must configure Apache to redirect the URL
'Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync' to the index.php file in the Z-Push
directory. This can be done by adding the line:

    Alias /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync /usr/share/z-push/index.php

to your httpd.conf file. Make sure that you are adding the line to the
correct part of your Apache configuration, taking care of virtual hosts and
other Apache configurations.
Another possibility is to add this line to z-push.conf file inside the directory
which contents are automatically processed during the webserver start (by
default it is conf.d inside the /etc/apache2 or /etc/httpd depending on your
distribution).

You have to reload your webserver after making these configurations.

*WARNING* You CANNOT simply rename the z-push directory to
Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync. This will cause Apache to send redirects to the
mobile device, which will definitely break your mobile device synchronisation.

Lastly, make sure that PHP has the following settings:

    php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
    php_flag register_globals off
    php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
    php_flag short_open_tag on

You can set this in the httpd.conf, in php.ini or in an .htaccess file in
the root of z-push.

If you have several php applications on the same system, you could specify the
z-push directory so these settings are considered only there.
    <Directory /usr/share/z-push>
        php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
        php_flag register_globals off
        php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
        php_flag short_open_tag on
    </Directory>

If you don't set this up correctly, you will not be 
able to login correctly via z-push.

Please also set a memory_limit for php to 128M in php.ini.

Z-Push writes files to your file system like logs or data from the
FileStateMachine (which is default). In order to make this possible,
you either need to disable the php-safe-mode in php.ini or .htaccess with
    php_admin_flag safe_mode off
or configure it accordingly, so Z-Push is allowed to write to the 
log and state directories. 

After doing this, you should be able to synchronize with your mobile device.

To use the command line tools, access the installation directory 
(usually /usr/share/z-push) and execute:
    ./z-push-top.php        and/or
    ./z-push-admin.php

To facilitate the access symbolic links can be created, by executing:
    ln -s /usr/share/z-push/z-push-admin.php /usr/sbin/z-push-admin
    ln -s /usr/share/z-push/z-push-top.php /usr/sbin/z-push-top

With these symlinks in place the cli tools can be accessed from any 
directory and without the php file extension.


Upgrade
-------
Upgrading to a newer Z-Push version follows the same path as the
initial installation.
When upgrading to a new minor version e.g. from Z-Push 1.4 t
Z-Push 1.4.1, the existing Z-Push directory can be overwritten
when extracting the archive. When installing a new major version
it is recommended to extract the tarball to another directory and
to copy the state from the existing installation.

*Important*
It is crucial to always keep the data of the state directory in order
to ensure data consistency on already synchronized mobiles.

Without the state information mobile devices, which already have an
ActiveSync profile, will receive duplicate items or the synchronization
will break completely.

*Important*
Upgrading to Z-Push 2.X from 1.X it is not necessary to copy the state
directory because states are not compatible. However Z-Push 2 implements
a fully automatic resynchronizing of devices in the case states are
missing or faulty.

*Important*
Downgrading from Z-Push 2.X to 1.X is not simple. As the states are not
compatible you would have to follow the procedure for a new installation
and re-create profiles on every device.

*Important*
States of Z-Push 2.0 and Z-Push 2.1 are not compatible. A state migration
script is available in the tools folder.

Please also observe the published release notes of the new Z-Push version.
For some releases it is necessary to e.g. resynchronize the mobile. 


S/MIME
------
Z-Push supports signing and en-/decrypting of emails on mobile devices
since the version 2.0.7.

*Important*
Currently only Android 4.X and higher and iOS 5 and higher devices are
known to support encryption/signing of emails.

It might be possible that PHP functions require CA information in order
to validate certs. Therefore the CAINFO parameter in the config.php
must be configured properly.

The major part of S/MIME deployment is the PKI setup. It includes the
public-private key/certificate obtaining, their management in directory
service and roll-out to the mobile devices. Individual certificates can
either be obtained from a local (company intern) or a public CA. There
are various public CAs offering certificates: commercial ones e.g.
Symantec or Comodo or community-driven e.g. CAcert.org.

Both most popular directory services Microsoft Active Directory (MS AD)
and free open source solution OpenLDAP allow to save certificates. Private
keys/certificates reside in user’s directory or on a smartcard. Public
certificates are saved in directory. MS AD and OpenLDAP both use 
serCertificate attribute to save it.

In Active Directory the public key for contacts from GAB is saved in
PR_EMS_AB_TAGGED_X509_CERT (0x8C6A1102) property and if you save a key
in a contact it’s PR_USER_X509_CERTIFICATE (0x3A701102).

In LDAP public key for contacts from GAB is saved in userCertificate
property. It should be mapped to 0x3A220102 in ldap.propmap.cfg
(0x3A220102 = userCertificate). Make sure it looks like this in LDAP:

userCertificate;binary
    MIIFGjCCBAKgAwIBAgIQbRnqpxlPa… 

*Important*
It is strongly recommended to use MS AD or LDAP to manage certificates.
Other user plugin options like db or unix might not work correctly and
are not supported.

Setting up your mobile device
-----------------------------

This is simply a case of adding an 'exchange server' to your activesync
server list, specifying the IP address of the Z-Push's apache server,
disabling SSL, unless you have already setup SSL on your Apache server,
setting the correct username and password (the domain is ignored, you can
simply specify 'domain' or some other random string), and then going through
the standard activesync settings.

Once you have done this, you should be able to synchronise your mobile
simply by clicking the 'Sync' button in ActiveSync on your mobile.

*NOTE* using the synchronisation without SSL is not recommended because
your private data is transmitted in clear text over the net. Configuring
SSL on Apache is beyond of the scope of this document. Please refer to
Apache documention available at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/


Troubleshooting
---------------

Most problems will be caused by incorrect Apache settings. To test whether
your Apache setup is working correctly, you can simply type the Z-Push URL
in your browser, to see if apache is correctly redirecting your request to
z-push. You can simply use:

    http://<serverip>/Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync

If correctly configured, you should see a username/password request and
when you specify a valid username and password, you should see a Z-Push
information page, saying that this kind of requests is not supported.
Without authentication credentials Z-Push displays general information.

If not then check your PHP and Apache settings and Apache error logs.

If you have other synchronisation problems, you can increase the LOGLEVEL
parameter in the config e.g. to LOGLEVEL_DEBUG or LOGLEVEL_WBXML.

The z-push.log file will then collect detailed debug information from your
synchronisation.

*NOTE* This setting will set Z-Push to log the detailed information for
*every* user on the system. You can set a different log level for particular
users by adding them comma separated to $specialLogUsers in the config.php
 e.g. $specialLogUsers = array("user1", "user2", "user3");
 
 *NOTE* Be aware that if you are using LOGLEVEL_DEBUG and LOGLEVEL_WBXML
 Z-Push will be quite talkative, so it is advisable to use log-rotate
 on the log file.
 
*Repeated incorrect password messages*
If a password contains characters which are encoded differently in ISO-8859-1
and Windows-1252 encodings (e.g. "§") the login might fail with Z-Push but
it works fine with the WebApp/Webaccess. The solution is to add:

setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "en_US.UTF-8");

to the config.php file.
