BackendIMAP - NOTES
===================

This backend support the Search operation in the mailbox.
Since the IMAP search operation is pretty slow, with a medium/big mailbox, or with a lots of folders,
the mobile device will timeout the operation before this is completed on server.

I'm using Dovecot + FTS-SOLR plugin so the real search is done against an Apache SOLR server.
It reduces a 1-2 minutes search to 1-5 seconds, and the response is given to the mobile device in time.


CHANGESSINK
===========
It supports ChangesSink method that will detect and send faster changes to your device.


SMTP
====
You can choice between 3 methods for send mails: mail (php mail), sendmail (native binary), smtp (php smtp direct connection).

For "smtp" you will need to install Pear::Net_SMTP in your system (and it must be accesible in php path).

"mail" is a sendmail wrapper in Linux.
