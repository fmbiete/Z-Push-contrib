 *  Synchronize additional folders to all mobiles
 *
 *  With this feature, special folders can be synchronized to all mobiles.
 *  This is useful for e.g. global company contacts.
 *
 *  This feature is supported only by certain devices, like iPhones.
 *  Check the compatibility list for supported devices:
 *      http://z-push.sf.net/compatibility
 *
 *  To synchronize a folder, add a section setting all parameters as below:
 *      store:      the ressource where the folder is located.
 *                  Zarafa users use 'SYSTEM' for the 'Public Folder'
 *      folderid:   folder id of the folder to be synchronized
 *      name:       name to be displayed on the mobile device
 *      type:       supported types are:
 *                      SYNC_FOLDER_TYPE_USER_CONTACT
 *                      SYNC_FOLDER_TYPE_USER_APPOINTMENT
 *                      SYNC_FOLDER_TYPE_USER_TASK
 *                      SYNC_FOLDER_TYPE_USER_MAIL
 *
 *  Additional notes:
 *  - on Zarafa systems use backend/zarafa/listfolders.php script to get a list
 *    of available folders
 *
 *  - all Z-Push users must have full writing permissions (secretary rights) so
 *    the configured folders can be synchronized to the mobile
 *
 *  - this feature is only partly suitable for multi-tenancy environments,
 *    as ALL users from ALL tenents need access to the configured store & folder.
 *    When configuring a public folder, this will cause problems, as each user has
 *    a different public folder in his tenant, so the folder are not available.

 *  - changing this configuration could cause HIGH LOAD on the system, as all
 *    connected devices will be updated and load the data contained in the
 *    added/modified folders.
